## Roadmap

- [x] Orbiting moon

- [x] Playable moon biome

  - [x] Lunar terrain

  - [ ] Disable any spawning events (drastically increase performance)

  - [ ] Disable all walking caravan/raiders events (replace with orbital trading and drop pod raids)

  - [ ] Drasticly increase/decrease temperature depending on night and day cycle

  - Harvesting resources

   - [ ] Mining vessels operated by colonist traveling to "asteroids" to mine random minerals and chunks (can just be behind the scenes like the empire mod - good for performance)

   - [ ] Random anomalies that the user can decide what they want to do with. Random outcomes (like text-based RPG games)

   - [ ] A ship capable landing on the Rimworld to gather resources

   - [ ] (Late game) AI Ships capable of mining and hauling (from one planet to another) without colonist operating

- [ ] Add oxygen variable (Maybe depend on sos2)

- [ ] Add functioning solar system
